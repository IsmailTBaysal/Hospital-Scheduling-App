## Documentation
Documentation was good except that the sql files for creating the database were not included in the repository. 

## The code is well-organized, using an MVC approach
Code is well organized and follows the MVC structure

## The application includes functional unit testing for each part of the application
Was not able to perform most of the unit tests.  Looked at code and they looked fine. 

## The application demonstrates the appropriate use of error handling
Lots of try catch blocks.  Good structure and reasonable error handling on the front end.  I was able to add a phone number of 123-abc-1234 to the database. I did not see any custom error handling which you may want to consider. 

## The application uses Spring tools to build and organize the code
Good use of all appropriate @ annotations to build application

## The application includes a database
Database was well thought out and could be easily expanded.  I had to search for the *.sql files to build it locally. 

## The application uses JDBCTemplate or JPA to perform CRUD operations on data using appropriate REST API endpoints
Good use of JDBCTemplate to build the application

## The application includes a frontend GUI interface to interact with the end user
Excellent interface! 

## The application uses a version control system for code
Used GitHub repo

## The project was presented to the class
Excellent presentation!
